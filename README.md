# CustomTA

## Overview

- Static single webpage with search-as-you-type capability on any data you provide
- Hosted on Github-Pages [here](https://stephgbzh.github.io/customta/?json=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StephGbzh/customta/master/data.json)
  - you can provide some other data by changing the json parameter in the url bar and setting it to another online json file (see below for details about the expected format)
  - when the search field is empty, all unfiltered results are available (not all are shown at once but there is a "Load more" button if you scroll down to the bottom)
  - type ESC or click the X in the search field to clear your last search
- Locally the page to open is simply index.html and works the same way
- Powered by [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Source code is in src/main.jsx (no need to change anything here if you just want to use the search)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) through npx transforms this jsx code to plain js (see further below for the exact command)
- Tested with moderately small amounts of data (~1000 elements with 5 fields), bigger ones may be slow to handle

## Json format

You will need to build and host online a json containing:

- a **documents** entry, the value being an array of the elements you want to search through
- a short **fields** part describing the fields of these elements
  - list only the fields from the **documents** elements you want to take into account for the search, others will be ignored
  - the **order** you choose for the fields in the **fields** part will be used to display each result and that order can be different from the one in the **documents** elements
  - the **type** of each field will determine how it is displayed
    - list: an array is expected, each value will be enclosed in a colored border and have a small color square before it
    - link: a clickable link will be generated
    - text: the element as a simple string of characters
  - the importance of a field for the search can be tweaked through the **boost** value, default is 1, increase it to make this field more important than others

Look at <https://github.com/StephGbzh/customta/blob/master/data.json> for an example.

## Use locally

1. Clone the repository, you will need these files:
    - index.html
    - style.css
    - main.js
    - libs/lunr@2.3.8.min.js
    - libs/react@16.13.1.production.min.js
    - libs/react-dom@16.13.1.production.min.js
    - favicon.ico
1. Open index.html in your browser
1. Start searching !

You can also serve the files from a local server, for example with a line of python:

```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Or rather a few lines in a [script](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21957017) to handle any CORS problem.

Then open <http://localhost:8000/?json=http://localhost:8000/data.json>

## Use hosted on GitHub

1. Fork the repository.
1. Go to your repo Settings > Options > GitHub Pages > Source: choose branch = master and folder = / (root)
1. This will create a website hosted on GitHub (you may need a small delay for it to be created + a refresh of the page to get the address)
1. Access this site and start searching !

## JS Search Engines

Several search engines have been written in Javascript, here are those that were considered, along with some notes that helped choose one among them.

### [LUNR](https://lunrjs.com/)

#### Simple

Designed to be small, yet full featured, Lunr enables you to provide a great search experience without the need for external, server-side, search services.

#### Extensible

Add powerful language processors to give more accurate results to user queries, or tweak the built-in processors to better fit your content.

#### Everywhere

Lunr has no external dependencies and works in your browser or on the server with node.js

Pros:

- lightweight (6 kB)
- search with wildcards
- boosts fields
- fuzzy search

Cons:

- slower ? not sure, the benchmarks were made against v2.x
- indexes are immutable => no add/update/delete
- need to tweak with worse perf to access reliable wildcard + "AND" functionalities [link](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js/issues/377#issuecomment-426380071)

### [Elasticlunr.js](http://elasticlunr.com/)

Lightweight full-text search engine in Javascript for browser search and offline search.

Elasticlunr.js is a lightweight full-text search engine in Javascript for browser search and offline search. Elasticlunr.js is developed based on Lunr.js, but more flexible than lunr.js. Elasticlunr.js provides Query-Time boosting and field search. Elasticlunr.js is a bit like Solr, but much smaller and not as bright, but also provide flexible configuration and query-time boosting.

Elasticlunr.js use quite the same scoring mechanism as Elasticsearch

Pros:

- faster than lunr

Cons:

- [no wildcard search](https://github.com/weixsong/elasticlunr.js/issues/81), only suffixes: micro will get microservice and microcosm but NOT minimicro

### [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/)

Fuse.js is a powerful, lightweight fuzzy-search library, with zero dependencies.

What is fuzzy searching?

Generally speaking, fuzzy searching (more formally known as approximate string matching) is the technique of finding strings that are approximately equal to a given pattern (rather than exactly).

Why should I use it ?

- With Fuse.js, you donâ€™t need to setup a dedicated backend just to handle search.
- Simplicity and performance were the main criteria when developing this library.

When should I use it ?

It might not make sense for every situation, but can be ideal depending on your search requirements. For example:

- When you want client-side fuzzy searching of small to moderately large data sets.
- When you can't justify setting up a dedicated backend simply to handle search. ElasticSearch or Algolia, although both great services, may be overkill for your particular use cases.

Pros:

- still maintained

Cons:

- not really looked into it

### [search-index](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/search-index)

A network resilient, persistent full-text search library for the browser and Node.js

Pros:

- still maintained

Cons:

- not really looked into it

### [js-search](https://github.com/bvaughn/js-search)

Js Search enables efficient client-side searches of JavaScript and JSON objects. It is ES5 compatible and does not require jQuery or any other third-party libraries.

Js Search began as a lightweight implementation of Lunr JS, offering runtime performance improvements and a smaller file size. It has since expanded to include a rich feature set- supporting stemming, stop-words, and TF-IDF ranking.

[Gatsby: Adding Search with JS Search](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-search-with-js-search/)

Pros:

- still maintained
- search by prefix or substring or exact word

Cons:

- not really looked into it

### [flexsearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch)

Next-Generation full text search library for Browser and Node.js

Pros:

- fastest one (self proclaimed though)

Cons:

- [not maintained](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch/issues/150) anymore since Nov 2019

## [Add React to a Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

For development, add these scripts:

```js
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.min.js" crossorigin></script>
```

For production, add minified scripts for react & react-dom:

```js
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
```

Add JSX to a Project (node.js must be installed)

`npm init -y`

`npm install babel-cli@6 babel-preset-react-app@3`

Create a folder `src` and start the automatic watcher that will transform the jsx files in js everytime the file changes:

`npx babel --watch src --out-dir . --presets react-app/prod`
